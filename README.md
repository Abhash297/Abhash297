# Hi there, I'm Abhash! 👋

## 🌟 About Me
I’m Abhash Shrestha, a passionate **Computer Scientist**, **Data Scientist**, and **Software Engineer** based in Kathmandu, Nepal. I recently completed my **MSc in Computer Science** at the **University of Southampton**, where I specialized in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Deep Learning (DL)**.

Over the years, I have worked on cutting-edge projects that span diverse domains, including **bias mitigation in AI systems**, **GDPR compliance research**, **time series classification optimization**, and **algorithmic trading**. My experience also includes developing and deploying robust software solutions for leading organizations.

I'm actively seeking PhD opportunities to further my research ambitions in AI and its intersection with fairness, ethics, and large-scale applications.
